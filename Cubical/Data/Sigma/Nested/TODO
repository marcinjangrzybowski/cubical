-- try to parametrise SigmaBoundaries by (NCube n -> A)

-- implicit fields in records (for example for boundaries, where grat majpority of fileds could be infered
-- same for Cube^n

-- investiage origin of unwanted tranports


-- constructor for boundaries with only 2*n arguments, where skelet of codim = 2 is infered from faces
-- show that all fields can be infered from faces


--reconstruct commented funcions in /Nested/Path.agda, but this time without introducing subt nor transport
